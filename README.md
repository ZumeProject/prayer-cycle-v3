# Prayer Cycle

The Prayer Cycle is a simple tool for practicing prayer that you can use by yourself and share with any follower of Jesus. In just 12 simple steps - 5 minutes each - the Prayer Cycle guides you through 12 ways the Bible teaches us to pray. At the end, you’ll have prayed for an hour. The Bible tells us -- “Pray without ceasing.” Not many of us can say we do that. But after this hour of prayer - you’ll be a step closer.

## Prayer Steps

1. **PRAISE** - Start by praising the Lord for His goodness
2. **WAIT** - Spend time waiting on the Lord in silence
3. **CONFESS** - Confess sins and receive His forgiveness
4. **READ THE WORD** - Read and meditate on Scripture
5. **ASK** - Present personal needs and requests
6. **INTERCESSION** - Pray for others and their needs
7. **PRAY THE WORD** - Pray Scripture back to God
8. **THANK** - Express gratitude for blessings and answered prayers
9. **SING** - Worship through song and musical praise
10. **MEDITATE** - Focus on God's character and works
11. **LISTEN** - Be still and listen for God's voice
12. **PRAISE** - End as you began, with praise and thanksgiving

## Technology Stack

Built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite for a modern, responsive web application.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
